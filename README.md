You need to build a tool sharing website that allows for users to create an account and login. Users should be able to add their items with a picture and price of the item.
Each user should have a screen that lets them see just their rental items that they've added.
Users should be able to see a list of other users and the tools that are available and select one that they would like to borrow. Users can borrow multiple items, but each item should only be borrowed by a single user at one time.
If an item is already borrowed, it should be marked as not available.
 * Create an `accounts` app that will have your login and signup views.
 * Create a `tools` app that will have your models, views, and templates for the following screens:
 	* Home page: Welcome screen with links to create account, etc.
 	* My Items: Screen of just items that a user has added.
 	* User List: Screen with a listing of all users in the system.
 	* User Tool List: Screen with a listing of tools that are added by a specific user. Each tool marked as available or not and a "Borrow Now" button if the tool is available.
